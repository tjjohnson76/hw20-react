# hw20: React Portfolio

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating an online portfolio for ourselves in react. This project was to have four separate pages, an about me, portfolio of projects, contact, and resume. Due to time constraints, my assignment includes a fair bit of placeholder data that I plan to update once I have some more time.
